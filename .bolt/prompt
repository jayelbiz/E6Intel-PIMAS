Project-Specific Instructions for Bolt (E6:12 Intel - PIMAS)

1. Project Overview & Purpose
E6:12 Intel (PIMAS) is an AI-driven prophetic intelligence system designed to analyze news, media narratives, geopolitical events, and legislative movements through a biblical, prophetic, and intelligence-based lens. The system systematically detects:

Influence, bias, and psyops
Financial connections & legislative impact
Spiritual warfare indicators & prophetic alignment
Coordinated messaging & deception detection
Geolocation mapping & trend forecasting
This project is modular and phased, ensuring each component is fully functional before expanding.

2. Core Features & AI-Driven Components
A. Article & Media Analysis Workflow
Article Submission & Metadata Extraction

Ingests articles via URL submission, file uploads, or API integration.
Extracts metadata (title, author, source credibility, publication date).
Runs AI-based NLP processing to detect keywords, topics, sentiment, and structure.
AI-Driven Significance Score (Weighted Ranking System)

Assigns a 1-100 Significance Score based on:
Influence Level (Mainstream vs. Fringe Source)
Reach & Audience Impact (Corporate, Legislative, Global, Niche)
Legislative Impact (Does it drive policy?)
Narrative Control (Does it set ideological direction?)
Historical Parallels (Echoes past psyops?)
Financial & Political Beneficiaries
Alignment with Prophetic Timelines & Biblical Intelligence
Pros & Cons Evaluation

Pros: Social justice, constitutional alignment, free speech advocacy, economic growth.
Cons: Legislative overreach, ideological conditioning, financial control, spiritual deception.
Deep Categorization

Legal & Constitutional Impact (Legislation tracking, overreach detection).
Spiritual Warfare Perspective (Biblical alignment, deception tracking).
Financial Beneficiaries & Funding Sources (Corporate & NGO funding analysis).
Media Syndication & Coordination (Narrative repetition across media).
Psyops & Narrative Control Detection

Identifies coordinated messaging, emotional manipulation, suppression of dissenting viewpoints.
AI Metrics & Visualization

Generates heatmaps, network graphs, timeline trends, dashboards for analysis.
Real-time Automation & Future Expansion

Automated deception detection via NLP-based framing analysis.
Geolocation mapping of propaganda spread.
Crowdsourced verification & user intelligence submissions.
Machine learning-driven trend prediction.
3. Implementation Strategy
A. Technical Stack
Frontend: PrimeReact (Airbnb UI style) + TailwindCSS.
Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL for storage, real-time event tracking).
AI Models: DeepSeek R1 + OpenAI for NLP-based analysis, narrative detection, and event classification.
APIs & Data Aggregation:
News & OSINT APIs: Google News, NewsAPI.org, GDELT.
Social Media Monitoring APIs: Twitter/X API, Telegram Bot API.
Metadata Verification APIs: WhoisXML API, OpenWeb.
AI NLP Tools: DeepSeek R1, OpenAI.
B. Feature Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Article Ingestion & Metadata Extraction

Develop API integrations for Google News, NewsAPI, OSINT feeds.
Create Supabase database schema for raw articles & metadata.
Implement validation checks for duplicate or low-quality sources.
Phase 2: NLP-Based Keyword Analysis & Classification

Use AI NLP models to extract key topics, entities, locations.
Define classification mapping linking news topics to biblical events.
Assign confidence scores to AI-generated classifications.
Phase 3: Event Scoring & Psyops Detection

Develop weighted scoring logic for influence, reach, bias detection.
Implement AI-based pattern recognition for coordinated messaging.
Phase 4: AI-Powered Visualization & Geolocation Mapping

Build interactive dashboards, trend analysis graphs.
Implement geolocation mapping for article-based intelligence.

4. Design & UI/UX Style
Style: Follow Airbnb.com UI to the pixel or as close as possible.
Framework: PrimeReact + TailwindCSS.
Dashboard: Needs to be clean,very compact, lower scale, technical, futuristic, dark-themed (inspired by airbnb UI).

User Interactions:
Drag-and-drop article uploads.
Real-time intelligence tracking.
Search & filter functionality.
5. Monetization & Scaling Strategy
Phase 1: MVP Deployment & User Feedback Collection
Phase 2: AI Enhancements & OSINT API Expansion
Phase 3: Community-Driven Intelligence Contributions
Phase 4: Enterprise Licensing & Subscription Model
Premium Subscriptions: Advanced intelligence reports & AI-driven alerts.
Enterprise Licensing: Security analysts & investigative journalists.
Crowdfunding & Donations: Community-funded intelligence operations.
API Partnerships: OSINT tool integrations.
6. Security & Data Integrity
Secure API keys, encrypted user data.
AI-driven misinformation filtering using cross-validation techniques.
User access control for different intelligence tiers.

Final Notes for Bolt:

All code-generated prompts must be highly detailed.

Any AI-generated instructions must be repeatable for another AI to execute independently.

Ensure documentation is comprehensive, covering storage, database setup, API logic.

Prioritize AI-assisted deception detection, narrative tracking, and psyops analysis.

Optimize system logic for real-time event scanning & spiritual warfare intelligence.
